- [ ] When there are multiple files in the same folder that contains the regex pattern (for example, 00 and 01), the plugin will only read the last file (01) and ignore the first file (00). This is because the plugin uses `match` to find the first occurrence of the regex pattern, which may not be the intended behavior when there are multiple files. To fix this, we can use `matchAll` instead of `match` to find all occurrences of the regex pattern in the content.
- [ ] Add a "Generate indexes for current folder and subfolders" command to the plugin.
- [ ] Add a "Generate index file for all folders in vault" command to the plugin. This command will generate an index file for each folder in the vault, including subfolders. Initially it will not populate the index file with links, for this the user must run one of the "Generates indexes ..." commands". The name of this file should be configurable in the settings. It should use the `indexIdentifier` in the title of the file, for example `${indexIdentifier} - Index`.
